Hopes rise, dreams flicker, love plans for tomorrow, loneliness thinks of yesterday

Roses are red 
Violets are blue 
Me and you thesis 
We're almost through 

I yearn for the day
When you want no more 
You endless abyss 
You constant chore

Submitted, accepted 
A thing of the past
Finally over 
Finished at last 

And then what?
What then shall I do 
Simply find another 
Problem or two? 

A post doc? 
Maybe industry? 
As if I'll have a choice
In this economy!

Thesis, oh thesis 
As I near the end 
When we finally part 
I won't ask to stay friends
